Amazon Foundations,Core Amazon Terminology,Core Amazon Terms and Definitions,Definition: 1P,"1P stands for 1st Party and essentially refers to wholesalers, manufacturers or distributors selling direct to Amazon through the Vendor Central platform.
Most 1P businesses opt to sell to the 3P retailer and have them sell direct to the consumer through the Seller Central Platform.
But, with the exceptional growth of eCommerce as well as the changing trend in marketing to focus more on the consumer themselves, a lot of 1P businesses are opting now to also sell to consumers directly through Amazon by using the Seller Central platform that is used primarily by 3P businesses or retailers.
As a 1P business selling on Seller Central you still have the option to sell to Amazon directly and ship to their Fulfillment Centers as opposed to shipping direct to the consumer’s door.",01/14/2020

Amazon Foundations,Core Amazon Terminology,Core Amazon Terms and Definitions,Definition: Account Health,Your Account Health on both Seller Central and Vendor Central is displayed on the home page of either dashboard.
It is based on performance metrics of your account, most notably any operational infractions which have resulted in chargebacks, any payments outstanding to Amazon, amounts of unauthorized returns still pending, and a variety of other similar items.
It basically boils down to how well you are running your account with Amazon by complying with all of Amazon’s Terms and Conditions of Trade.
If your Account Health deteriorates too much, Amazon can and will suspend or even terminate your account with them.,01/14/2020
Amazon Foundations,Core Amazon Terminology,Core Amazon Terms and Definitions,Definition: Amazon Media Group (AMG),Amazon Media Group (AMG) is the business team that works with marketers who access the two primary advertising platforms: Amazon Marketing Services (AMS) and the Amazon Advertising Platform (AAP).
As of September 2018, however, Amazon has retired all the various terms and has bundled them into simply “Amazon Advertising”.
This new platform name will still house all of the various platforms already found in the above AMS and AAP or DSP as it later became known.,01/14/2020
Amazon Foundations,Core Amazon Terminology,Core Amazon Terms and Definitions,Definition: Brand Registry,The Brand Registry is a program created by Amazon to assist Amazon sellers and suppliers who manufacture their own brand of product to protect that brand’s integrity on the Amazon website.
You would need to have a Vendor or Seller Central Account in order to register for Brand Registry, or you can create a new account, and you would also need to have the various valid copyrighting and Trademark registrations in place to prove you own the brand and the trademark belongs to you.
This is so that you can protect your products from any intellectual property rights violations and to assist you in having greater control over what images, product names, descriptions, et cetera other people use when listing your products on any of the Amazon marketplaces.,01/14/2020
Amazon Foundations,Core Amazon Terminology,Core Amazon Terms and Definitions,Definition: Brand Gating,Brand Gating is a program that Amazon has created where Amazon can block unauthorised retailers or sellers from selling your products on Amazon.
Over the years, many companies have had to face such retailers reselling their products unknown by the brand or company itself on Amazon, resulting in unauthorised sales of these products and poor representation of the product itself.
The general term used when a product is poorly presented or priced well below its actual value is brand-erosion.
Because Amazon consumers are not aware of where most of the products come from on Amazon, they unwittingly assisted in brand-erosion so Amazon had to offer its Suppliers a solution to these unauthorised sellers and so Brand Gating was introduced.
Amazon offers brand gating to manufacturers and authorized resellers to retain the control over their brands and labels.,01/14/2020
Amazon Foundations,Core Amazon Terminology,Core Amazon Terms and Definitions,Definition: Gated Brand,Gated Brand refers to individual brands that can be restricted and you, as a Vendor or Seller, would need to apply to sell.
This normally involves getting invoices and written permission from the brand itself to sell their product on Amazon.,01/15/2020

Amazon Foundations,Core Amazon Terminology,Core Amazon Terms and Definitions,Definition: Cost of Goods Sold (COGS),Amazon’s cost of goods sold is what you sell your products to Amazon for, or what Amazon purchases your products from you for.
The Cost of Goods Sold to Amazon is relatively complex as it cannot only be your landed or ex-warehouse cost.
It would need to include such items as your co-op agreements that you accept when starting business with Amazon, any programs such as subscribe and save or prime, and some additional buffers which can assist you in preventing excessive losses from chargeback and penalty fees.,01/14/2020
Amazon Foundations,Core Amazon Terminology,Core Amazon Terms and Definitions,Definition: Contra COGS,The Contra Cost of Goods Sold is funding that a vendor gives Amazon, excluding advertising and sales promotions.
It will include such backend items as Market Development Funds or Co-Op Agreement Fees, Vine and ARA Premium – basically the buffers you would need to add to your landed or ex warehouse cost to generate the overall price that you sell your product to Amazon for.,01/14/2020

Amazon Foundations,Core Amazon Terminology,Core Amazon Terms and Definitions,Definition: Pure Product Margin (PPM),Pure Product Margin is a measure of profitability based on Pure Product Profit.

Amazon Foundations,Core Amazon Terminology,Core Amazon Terms and Definitions,Definition: Net Pure Product Margin (Net PPM),Net Pure Product Margin is a measure of profitability, similar to PPM, but where the additional terms of vendor-funded CCOGS (VFCC) and Sales Discounts are also factored into the calculation.,01/14/2020
Amazon Foundations,Core Amazon Terminology,Core Amazon Terms and Definitions,Definition: Revenue,One of the key metrics that businesses and analysts use to track performance is revenue.
Revenue is income from normal business activities over a period of time.
As more and more small businesses make a substantial portion of their sales online, the difference between digital and retail revenue can reveal information about consumer habits and sales strategies.
The difference between retail and digital revenue is important to the businesses that earn money from both sources.
Retail revenue indicates the need to produce and ship a physical product, whereas digital revenue comes from content that is easy and inexpensive to reproduce.
While retail revenue is subject to the risks associated with damaged products and theft, digital revenue faces losses from illegal duplication unless businesses can control copyright management of digital products.
Growing digital revenue may reduce retail revenue, which indicates a shift in marketing and sales strategies.,01/14/2020
Amazon Foundations,Core Amazon Terminology,Core Amazon Terms and Definitions,Definition: Search Engine Optimization (SEO),Search engine optimization is the process of increasing the quality and quantity of website traffic by increasing the visibility of a website or a web page to users of a web search engine.
SEO refers to the improvement of unpaid results and excludes direct traffic/visitors and the purchase of paid placement.
As an Internet marketing strategy, SEO considers how search engines work, the computer programmed algorithms which dictate search engine behavior, what people search for, the actual search terms or keywords typed into search engines, and which search engines are preferred by their targeted audience.
SEO is performed because a website will receive more visitors from a search engine the higher the website ranks in the search engine results page (SERP).
These visitors can then be converted into customers.
SEO differs from local search engine optimization in that the latter is focused on optimizing a business' online presence so that its web pages will be displayed by search engines when a user enters a local search for its products or services.
The former instead is more focused on national or international searches.,01/14/2020
Amazon Foundations,Core Amazon Terminology,Core Amazon Terms and Definitions,Definition: A9,Amazon’s Search Engine was developed by A9.com, a subsidiary of Amazon.
The A9 Algorithm is the system which Amazon uses to decide how products are ranked in search results.
It is similar to the algorithm which Google uses for its search results, in that it considers keywords in deciding which results are most relevant to the search and therefore which it will display first.
However, there is one key difference between Google and Amazon’s algorithms: the A9 algorithm also puts a strong emphasis on sales conversions.
This is because Amazon is a business and has a vested interest in promoting listings which are more likely to result in sales.
Therefore, Amazon will rank listings with a strong sales history and high conversion rate more highly.
This has a cumulative effect: products which are more highly ranked are more likely to receive more traffic and thus have a better chance of achieving high sales.
In turn, this will boost their ranking, and so on.
This is why many sellers and vendors on Amazon opt to optimize this algorithm through paid advertising and keyword and content manipulation for their listings.,01/14/2020
Amazon Foundations,Core Amazon Terminology,Core Amazon Terms and Definitions,Definition: Search Volume,Search Volume refers to which keywords are used most by Amazon customers when searching on Amazon for products.
There are a number of online tools available to Vendors and Sellers that allow you to track and collect the most profitable merchant words from millions of Amazon search terms.
Simple yet functional tools perform a huge job by analyzing over 500 million keywords and search phrases.
These systems quickly track and identify the most up-to-date keywords ensuring that you have the most accurate information.,01/14/2020
Amazon Foundations,Core Amazon Terminology,Core Amazon Terms and Definitions,Definition: Drop-Shipping,Drop-Shipping is the term used when you sell to one party, in this case Amazon, but you ship directly to another address, in this case the Amazon business or the consumer’s doorstep.
For Amazon specifically, the term is described as “the manufacturer or distributor ships directly to your customers in your branded packaging.
The seller never touches the stock, but you may pay a premium for this feature.”
This is most notably used if you are selling to a 3P seller using Seller Central but they or you opt to not keep stock in their warehouse and rather ship directly to the consumer when an order is placed.
It is cleaner for all parties as the Seller or Retailer doesn’t need to pay for a storage unit to house all your inventory in the event of a sale; and you can ensure that your product leaves your own facilities in your standard of packaging and preparation, giving the consumer the best experience you, as the manufacturer, would want them to have.,01/14/2020
Amazon Foundations,Core Amazon Terminology,Core Amazon Terms and Definitions,Definition: Free on Board (FOB),FOB is a shipping term that stands for “free on board.” If a shipment is designated FOB (the seller's location), then as soon as the shipment of goods leaves the seller's warehouse, the seller records the sale as complete. The buyer owns the products en route to its warehouse and must pay any delivery charges.
FOB is an initialism which pertains to the shipping of goods. Depending on specific usage, it may stand for Free On Board or Freight On Board. FOB specifies which party (buyer or seller) pays for which shipment and loading costs, and/or where responsibility for the goods is transferred. The last distinction is important for determining liability for goods lost or damaged in transit from the seller to the buyer.
Precise meaning and usage of “FOB” can vary significantly. International shipments typically use “FOB” as defined by the Incoterm standards, where it always stands for “Free On Board”. Domestic shipments within the US or Canada often use a different meaning, specific to North America, which is inconsistent with the Incoterm standards.
Within the United States, the term FOB is commonly used when shipping goods to indicate who pays loading and transportation costs, and/or the point at which the responsibility of the goods transfers from shipper to buyer.
“FOB shipping point” or “FOB origin” indicates the buyer pays shipping cost, and takes responsibility for the goods when the goods leave the seller’s premises. “FOB destination” designates the seller will pay shipping costs, and remain responsible for the goods until the buyer takes possession.
Amazon sellers are responsible for the item arriving at the buyer. FOB Destination means the title of goods transfers to the buyer at the receipt to the buyer (Amazon). FOB Origin means the title of goods transfers at the transfer from the seller to a carrier (not Amazon).,09/08/2020
Amazon Foundations,Core Amazon Terminology,Core Amazon Terms and Definitions,Definition: Fulfillment Center,Fulfillment Center is the correct term used by Amazon to describe its warehouse.
As there are many, many Amazon product storage warehouses around the globe, these Fulfillment Centers all have unique codes in which to identify them by and which Vendors, Sellers, Carriers, et cetera all make reference to when managing Purchase Orders and shipments to these Fulfillment Centers.
Amazon stores your products here, then prepares them and ships them to consumers when they are ordered.,01/14/2020

Amazon Foundations,Core Amazon Terminology,Core Amazon Terms and Definitions,Definition: Sales Rank,The Amazon sales rank – also called the Amazon Best Seller Ranking (BSR) or Best Seller List – is a number which captures the item’s popularity in a certain category.
Sales rank exists for all products that are part of a category (some products don’t have a category).
The Sales Rank interval can be between 1 and 1 million+.
A higher number means you are not getting a lot of sales while a smaller number shows that your product is selling well.
In short, the Sales Rank means the period of time since an item last sold.
Ideally the period between two sales should be as small as possible.
The Amazon sales rank shows how well a product is selling relative to other (competitor) products in the same category.
A product with sales rank #1 is currently the most-purchased product in that category; a product with sales rank (or best seller ranking) #2 is the second most-purchased product in that category, etc.
In other words, you can see how many other products are selling better than your own.
For example, if your product has a current rank of 20 in the Amazon best sellers list, then that means there are 19 other products in the same category that have a higher sales volume.
It’s important to remember that only products within the same main category are taken into consideration when calculating your sales rank.
That means, for each main product category there is one product in first place, one in second, one in third, etc.
One product can, however, have an Amazon sales rank in more than one sub-category.
This is why one product can rank #452 in the main category ‘Beauty’ but be ranked at #36 in the subcategory ‘Bath Accessories’.
Amazon itself doesn’t reveal exactly how the sales rank is calculated, which is why there are only theories and speculation surrounding the method.
It’s relatively evident that sales volume alone is taken into consideration and not other figures such as number of reviews, retail price, etc.
It’s unclear, however, which time frame is taken into consideration for the sales volume.
Some theories conclude that only sales from the last 12 hours are counted; Others posit time periods of 24 hours or more.
Although the current sales rank of a product is a good indication of how well it will sell, it’s also important to note the average rank as well  – a product’s rank can often be subject to trends and seasons.
A product’s current rank is simply a glance at very recent activity and is not necessarily an indication of future sales performance.,01/14/2020
Amazon Foundations,Core Amazon Terminology,Core Amazon Terms and Definitions,Definition: Buy Box,Amazon’s Buy Box is the top right section on a product page where customers can directly add items to their shopping carts.
Since many sellers on Amazon can sell the same product, they must compete to “win the Buy Box” for a certain product.
Winning the Amazon Buy Box simply means that you were chosen for the Buy Box placement.
When you win this placement, customers have a button to directly add your product to their carts, giving you an advantage over competing sellers.
Generally, one “New” and one “Used” condition offer will win the Buy Box, depending on the product.
For a seller to be eligible for the Buy Box, they must meet a set of performance-based requirements including order defect rate, customer shopping experience, time and experience on the Amazon selling platform, and status as a professional seller.
If multiple sellers meet the eligibility requirements, then Amazon compares these sellers on metrics including pricing, availability, fulfillment options, and customer service and decides on a winner.
The Buy Box incorporates the large “Add to Cart” and “Buy Now” buttons on each listing.
When you’re selling the same product as other sellers, it is vital to capture the Buy Box, as it is responsible for the majority of sales.,01/14/2020
Amazon Foundations,Core Amazon Terminology,Core Amazon Terms and Definitions,Definition: Buy Box Percentage,The Buy Box algorithm starts by analysing each offer by all the sellers of the product.
It then evaluates each offer on the basis of seller history, price and many other variables.
After carrying out the analysis, Amazon rewards the Buy Box to what it deems as the best buying options for its customers.
Not all sellers are eligible to win the Buy Box.
Amazon no longer awards the Buy Box to one seller but instead rotates the Buy Box between multiple sellers.
The Buy Box Percentage is the percentage of page views where the Buy Box appeared on the page for customers to add your product to their cart.
Your Buy Box Percentage is lowered when:
The product was out of stock.
The Buy Box would result in the customer purchasing from another seller.
Your product was not available for purchase using the Buy Box, most commonly if you’re selling a used item that appears on the “Other buying options” page.
Remember that the Buy Box Percentage only tells you whether your product would be purchased by a customer who clicked the Buy Box when they viewed the product page.
For example, if your Buy Box Percentage for an item is 34%, "this means that roughly 1/3 of the time a customer visited that page, had they purchased by clicking “Add to Cart”, your item would be sold.",01/14/2020
